Polymorphism: poly means many and morphism means forms
	Polymorphism is derived from greek words.
	in simple way we can say that one named method has different-different forms.

	a women -> wife
	
		-> sister
		-> mother
		-> daughter
		there are two types pf Polymorphism

1) method overloading: one class can contain more than one same name methods
note: python does not support method overloading

2) method overriding: parent and child both have same name method its called method overriding.
